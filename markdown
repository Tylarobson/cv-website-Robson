**Introduction**

For this assessment I have created a website that promotes myself. This website will consist of 4 pages that will contain useful information such as there will be a homepage, qualifications &amp; employment history page, contact me page and about me. To create the website, I needed to create some low fidelity sketches to show what the page will look like and where the information will go. By doing this it then gives me an outline of what the design will look like once it has been finished.

**Colour Scheme**

For the website the same colours will been used throughout the website, the background colours will be the same on each page. Below I have added blocks of the colours that will be used. The reason for this is because the colours chosen actually work well together instead of just block colours that don&#39;t look very good.

#FFFFFF, # #ADD8E6, #FF0000, #D3D3D3, #000000 

**Evaluation**

The website itself I feel that I clearly shows the problem that I set out to solve because this is a CV style website everything that included on the site is relevant to what is needed.  Creating a website style CV there can be some problems that you run along into such as when creating the HTML code for this sometimes thing is not correct so the code is broken.  Code is all about trial and error as sometimes there were full stops or missing symbols that were not in the correct place meaning some information did not display when viewing the site. To fix this, I needed to read through all code to make sure that there was not anything missing. On the contact me page I have included a form for the users, however I was trying to add JavaScript onto this so that if there were sections of the form that was not written out correctly or even filled out then there would be an error message that will show to the user if that happens. This was something that took a long time as I needed to validate every part of the form.

When testing the website, I opened the website up on chrome on my laptop and on my mobile, some of the features that were implemented onto the website stayed the same when the size of the screen changed. Adding a style of the code then means that it can then be made responsive meaning that when you change from desktop to mobile you will notice a change in the layout as the text and images can get bigger or smaller depending on the screen size. I had a hard time when making the page responsive as sometimes something else would break in the code and it wouldn&#39;t work however it took me just playing around with the numbers that it then all came together and would move according to the page.

When creating the designs, I changed my mind when looking at the page, this was because the page didn&#39;t look like it was flowing very well as in some places there was just blocks of colour that have not been used up. So this is where the designs where changing as then I added more information along the way to fill out the page. CVs are laid out in the most conventional way possible, and when creating into a website it makes it more interactive for the users. Overall I feel that the website showcases the self-promotion that I have chosen for the website.
